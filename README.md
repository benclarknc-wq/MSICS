# MSICS
Multi Speed Image Correlation Spectroscopy

This image correlation tool aims to accurately measure the diffusion dynamics of molecules from bidirectional mircoscope images of flourescent molecules. This is accomplished by conducting Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation Spectroscopy (STICS), which is a class of image analysis that compares photon counts throughout the pixels of an image based on the time lag between collected pixels and the spatial displacement between pixels. Other STICS methods exist looking between individual image frames (ICS probes one the order of ms), raster images (RICS probes on the order of 10 us), or immobile time traces (FCS probes on the order of 10 ns). Each method can probe different time scales dependent upon the geometery of the image collected. MSICS aims to probe time scales on the us scale a happy medium between RICS and FCS. By conducting this analysis one can gain diffusion information, the diffusion coefficeint of molecules in a solution, as well as the molecule concentration in the solution.
